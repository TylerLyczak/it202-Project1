Modify the bootstrap Agency template

1. Make the top section a carousel similar to the Modern Business template https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-modern-business/  ; but your client wants 4 items in the carousel.
2. Add a second row of services;
3. Make the portfolio section show two items per row instead of three;
4. Add another item to the About section;
5. Add another Section titled "Coming Soon" before the Contact section;  this section should have the proper alternating background color and the same type of headline.   And it should be linked in the nav bar at the top.
